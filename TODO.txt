Ranked by natural development order and priority. Complexity level (?) in * stars.

Current priority stack:
- Real-time, automatic session spawning            *****
- Verify the key count one

- Fix $; should set targetCol to infinity.
- Distinguish between USER_EXPLORE_FACTOR and ABSOLUTE_EXPLORE_FACTOR (stop at minimum of the results with these) 
- Change vector<string> to lines everywhere you can

- Be careful: handling normal vs insert mode "pos" with backspace/delete, x/X.
Normal
 0 1 2 3 4
0 1 2 3 4
Insert

If we are searching 0-4 normal, our insert search is 0-4 BECAUSE our normal is already extended doing [l, r) (don't want to delete that 4th character itself).
So don't do X for i=0, x for i=n-1, or <Backspace> for i=0, or <Delete> for i=n-1.
Symmetry maintained!

- simple symbols: *, #, %                          ***
- Search, n/N (heuristic best-matching prefix)     ***
- Operator motions                                 *****
- Insert Mode structure (just a lot more stuff)    *****
- Dot operator, brute force (worth space?)         **
- Separate pattern detection for potential macros? ***
- Visual Mode                                      ****
- Multiple buffers with gd, gr, link jumps         *****
- Feedback on preferred motion paradigms over time ****
- Reinforcement learning?                          *****

- Niche commands: -/+, ~, gu, gU,

- Build word indices                               **
- Numbers                                          ***
- f/t, ;/, motions                                 **
