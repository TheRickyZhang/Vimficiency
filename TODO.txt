Ranked by natural development order and priority. Complexity level (?) in * stars.

Current priority stack:
- Real-time, automatic session spawning            *****
- Verify the key count one


After done: startingState should be passed in the optimize call, not be a member of Optimizer

- simple symbols: *, #, %                          ***
- Search, n/N (heuristic best-matching prefix)     ***
- Operator motions                                 *****
- Insert Mode structure (just a lot more stuff)    *****
- Dot operator, brute force (worth space?)         **
- Separate pattern detection for potential macros? ***
- Visual Mode                                      ****
- Multiple buffers with gd, gr, link jumps         *****
- Feedback on preferred motion paradigms over time ****
- Reinforcement learning?                          *****

- Niche commands: -/+, ~, gu, gU,


Current view of sessions / continuous evaluation:





Done:
- Simulation                                       **
- Build word indices                               **
- Numbers                                          ***
- f/t, ;/, motions                                 **
- <C-d, u, f, b> page motions                      **
