Ranked by natural development order and priority. Complexity level (?) in * stars.

Current priority stack:
Implement counts
Build word indices, so that {cnt}w, W are more efficient
Take a slice of current current buffer, so normal mode search only operates under a specific window.

== Finish handling counts in applyParsedMotion! Not completed


After done: startingState should be passed in the optimize call, not be a member of Optimizer

- simple symbols: *, #, %                          ***
- Search, n/N (heuristic best-matching prefix)     ***
- Numbers (compress? Heuristic exact jumps)        ****
- Operator motions                                 *****
- Insert Mode structure (just a lot more stuff)    *****
- Real-time, automatic session spawning            *****
- Dot operator, brute force (worth space?)         **
- Separate pattern detection for potential macros? ***
- Visual Mode                                      ****
- Multiple buffers with gd, gr, link jumps         *****
- Feedback on preferred motion paradigms over time ****
- Reinforcement learning?                          *****

- Niche commands: -/+, ~, gu, gU,











Done:
- f/t, ;/, motions                                 **
- <C-d, u, f, b> page motions                      **
